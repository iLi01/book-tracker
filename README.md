## Book reading tracker
I like reading. One of my goals for this year was to read at least 20 books. I remember taking some notes on some random pieces of paper about each one I've read, but they got lost around the house after a while... So my solution was: build a mini app that tracks my reading using Java Script~!


##### What will the app do?
- **add / remove books**
- **calculate the %** precentege of reading progress (based on the total pages & current read pages)
- **add notes**: thoughts, ideas, quotes from the books that I've enjoyed 
- **keep track of added text** by saving everything into the local storage
- ** rate the book** after finishing it
